# SQL-Injection
this project was to identify and assess SQL Injection vulnerabilities in websites. By  exploiting these vulnerabilities, the project aimed to understand how attackers can gain unauthorized access  to databases, manipulate data, and compromise the security of web applications. The ultimate goal was to highlight the importance of securing databases against such attacks and to explore effective methods for preventing SQL Injection. 

Problem Statement:  
SQL Injection is one of the most notorious and dangerous vulnerabilities that can affect web applications. It 
involves injecting malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, which can then manipulate or 
retrieve data from the database in ways unintended by the application developers. This vulnerability can allow 
attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, and even execute administrative 
operations on the database. Despite the existence of well-known mitigation strategies, SQL Injection remains 
a common and critical threat to cybersecurity. 

Methodology:   
The project aimed to identify and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications using a systematic 
approach. The process involved multiple stages, each designed to deepen the understanding of the 
vulnerability and demonstrate the potential impact of an attack.  

1. Utilizing SQL Dorks (2024):  
o Research and Selection: The project began with the selection of SQL dorks for the year 2024. 
SQL dorks are specifically crafted search queries that help in finding websites potentially 
vulnerable to SQL Injection by leveraging search engines like Google. These queries are 
designed to look for specific patterns in website code or content that could indicate the 
presence of an SQL Injection vulnerability.

2. Identifying Vulnerable Websites:  
o Initial Screening: The initial screening of potential targets involved a closer examination of 
the websites identified through the dork searches. This included inspecting the URLs and 
forms for parameters that might be susceptible to SQL Injection. Common indicators included 
parameters like id, product, or user, which, if improperly handled, could be manipulated to 
inject SQL code.  
o Testing for Vulnerability: The next step was to manually test these parameters by introducing 
simple SQL elements, such as a single quote or a boolean expression. The server's response 
was carefully monitored for any signs of vulnerability, such as SQL error messages or 
unexpected behavior in the application. If the application responded in a way that suggested 
it was processing the injected SQL code, this confirmed the presence of a vulnerability.  
o Selection of Target Website: After identifying multiple potential targets, a specific website 
was selected for a more detailed analysis. This site demonstrated clear signs of vulnerability 
in its handling of URL parameters, making it an ideal candidate for further exploration.
